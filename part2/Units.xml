            <subsection title="1.1 An Introduction to HTML Structure Elements">
                <paragraph>
                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create elements that the user interacts with. Since HTML is a
                    Markup language, it is used to define the content and structure of the webpage. These contents act to display
                    information from a server, or to receive inputs from the user to send to a server for processing. HTML is the
                    front-end side (or Top tier) of the three-tier architecture. The three-tier architecture is used to help
                    define a separation of logic between the front-end and the back-end, where the tiers are called Top Tier
                    (or User Interface Tier or Client Tier), the Middle Tier (or Business Logic Tier), and the Bottom Tier
                    (or Data Tier or Information Tier).
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    HTML elements can appear differently depending on the browser used, as well as the browser version. Thus,
                    it is important to ensure that the elements being added into your application are compatible with a majority
                    of the web browsers. This will help ensure that everyone can use the application as it was intended and not
                    miss out on any features that you add in. To help with this, there are websites that can help compare and
                    contrast between different browsers to see which browsers can utilize which HTML elements. Some of them
                    are Html5Test.com and CanIUse.com
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    In this unit, we will be looking at a couple of page-structure elements, and in the next unit, we will look at
                    some different input types that are available in HTML5. So in this chapter, we will be looking at the
                    following page-structure elements: paragraph, table, div, a, and ul/ol/li elements.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    A quick note in regards to HTML elements is that each element can be given an unique ID (specified by the ID attribute).
                    The id can be used to identify a specific element on a page (each ID must be different on one given page). As well, CSS
                    attributes can be applied directly to an element with the specified ID. There will be more discussion on this later on.

            <subsection title="1.2 Paragraph Element">
                <paragraph>
                    In HTML, there exists a paragraph element, which can be created by using the &lt;img src="../shared/1.2_1.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt; tag. Paragraphs
                    are used to display text that the programmer wants the end-user to see. It helps with defining a structure for the document.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Here is an example of a couple of paragraph elements displayed over eachother.
                </paragraph>
                <image src="../shared/paragraph.png">Two paragraphs, one ontop of the other saying &quot;This is a paragraph&quot; and &quot;This is another paragraph&quot; respectively</image>
                <image src="../shared/paragraph_code.png">
                    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
                </image>
            </subsection>
            <subsection title="1.3 Table Element">
                <paragraph>
                    A table element is very useful for formatting data output and displaying tabular data. Tables begin by using the
                    &lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt; tag. This will create the outer boundary that contains the table. The rows of the
                    table can be created using the &lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; tags, which stands for "table row". Each of these tags that
                    are specified within a table element will create a new row. To create columns, the &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; tag
                    can be used. The "td" tag stands for "table data"
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Here is an example of a table creation, with 3 rows and 4 columns
                     &lt;table&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                    &lt;/table&gt;

                    &lt;table&gt;

                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;

            </subsection>
            <subsection title="1.4 Div Element">
                <paragraph>
                    A div element can be used to separate portions of the web page. A div is block-level element, meaning it has its own
                    padding, border, and margin spacing around the div's content. A div element can contain any other html elements
                    within it.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Here's an example of a div element with a paragraph inside of it. The div will have a 1px padding on the left and a 10px
                    padding on the right, with a blue dotted border.
                </paragraph>
                 <image src="../shared/div.png">A div with a paragraph that says "A paragraph inside a div", where the div has a 1px left padding, 10px right padding, a width of 100px, and a blue dotted border</image> 
                <image src="../shared/div_code.png">
                    &lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:1px; padding-right:10px; border-style:dotted; border-color:blue; width:100px;&quot;%gt;
                        &lt;p%gt;A paragraph inside a div&lt;/p%gt;
                    &lt;/div%gt;
                </image>
            </subsection>
            <subsection title="1.5 Anchor Element">
                <paragraph>
                    The anchor element can contain a link  that will redirect the user to the specified http address. The address can be
                    specified in the href attribute of the a element. Text can be placed between the start and end tags to create a
                    hyperlinked text (generally denoted with blue text and an underline beneath the text). Clicking the link will
                    change the color of the text to purple, denoting that the site had been visited before. CSS styles can be used
                    to change these behaviours, but they will be discussed later on.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Here's an example of an anchor element before and after it was clicked.
                    &lt;a href="#"&gt;Anchor Element&lt;/a&gt;
                </paragraph>
                <image src="../shared/a_before.png">Anchor element with the text "Anchor Element" before it was clicked (text is blue)</image>

                <image src="../shared/a_code.png">

            <subsection title="1.6 Lists">
                <paragraph>
                    Lists are used to order and more neatly display information. There are two kinds of lists that are available in HTML. Lists can
                    be displayed as either ordered or unordered lists. The difference is that ordered lists have an increasing index starting from one,
                    while the unordered list has bullet points for each element. Ordered Lists are created using the ol element, while unordered lists
                    use the ul element. The points inside these lists are created using the li element.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>Here is an example of an ordered list using the ol element.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    &lt;ol&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 1&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 2&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 3&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;ol/&gt;
                </paragraph>
                <image src="../shared/orderedlist_code.png">
                    &lt;ol&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 1&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 2&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 3&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;ol/&gt;
                </image>
                <paragraph>The same ordered list can be changed into an unordered list by replacing the ol element with a ul element, as shown below.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 1&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 2&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 3&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;ul/&gt;
                </paragraph>
                <image src="../shared/unorderedlist_code.png">
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 1&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 2&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 3&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;ul/&gt;
                </image>
                <paragraph>
                    Lists can also be nested inside eachother, called a nested list. Different lists can be nested within eachother, such as having an
                    ordered list nested inside an unordered list, and vice-versa. This is done the same way as creating a list, but ol and ul lists are
                    created within li element. Any number of lists can be nested within eachother. Here's an example of an unordered list nested inside an 
                    ordered list, which is nested inside another unordered list.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 1&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;Element 2&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt; Ordered Nested List
                            &lt;ol&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;Ordered Nested Element 1&lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;Ordered Nested Element 2&lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt; Unordered Nested List
                                    &lt;ul&gt;
                                        &lt;li&gt;Unordered Nested Element 1&lt;/li&gt;
                                        &lt;li&gt;Unordered Nested Element 2&lt;/li&gt;
                                        &lt;li&gt;Unordered Nested Element 3&lt;/li&gt;

            <subsection title="2.1 An Introduction to HTML Input Elements">
                <paragraph>
                    Now that you have some basic information on some HTML structure elements, it's time to investigate another important realm of
                    HTML, which are the input elements. These elements allow the user to provide data to the backend for processing. Generally, a
                    majority of input elements can be seen in forms, where the user enters some sensitive data that is used to query a database.
                    An example of this would be when someone is filling out registration information to sign up on a social media platform. Most
                    likely, you will be asked to fill in your First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Email Address, and Password. All of these inputs
                    use the HTML input elements that will be discussed. The inputs are also defined using the input tag
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    &lt;input type=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>    
                    There are other forms of inputs that are different than text inputs, such as range, color, date, email, number, search, and tel.
                    These different input forms can be created by filling in the value of the type attribute, seen inside of the input tag.
                </paragraph>
            </subsection>
            <subsection title="2.2 Range Input">
                <paragraph>
                     The input of type range creates a slider control. The slider has a max, min, step, and initial value that can be modified using the
                     element's attributes (max, min, step, and value respectively). As well, the starting location of the slider can be specified with the value attribute. 
                     A slider is self-validating, as the only viable values are the ones in the range of the specified maximum and minimum.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Here's an example of a range input, where the maximum value is 100, the minimum value is 12, and the starting value is 51.
                    Note that in this example, the range input is enclosed by a label to define display the maximum and minimum values.
                </paragraph>

                    &lt;label&gt;

            <subsection title="2.3 Color Input">
                <paragraph>
                    The input of type color allows for the user to access a color picker dialog box. The dialog box is accessible by clicking
                    the "button" that the input element creates. This "button" also shows the color that the user has chosen (default to black)
                    The color picker dialog is the standard windows dialog that shows up if you were to use somthing like Microsoft Paint.
                    After the user selects a color and presses the "OK" button, the dialog will close and the user selected color will be
                    displayed in the input element.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Here's an example of how to create an HTML color picker.

            <subsection title="2.4 Date Input">
                <paragraph>
                    The input of type date creates an input textbox that allows the user to update the date values in multiple ways.
                    First, the user can directly update the date by typing into box in the respective fields (year, month, and day).
                    Another way is by clicking into a field and pressing the up and down arrows on the spinner controls.
                    The last way is by clicking an arrow next to the spinners that opens up a calendar, allowing the user to select the date
                    from there. Note that the last two ways are not shown in Firefox or IE12 or earlier browsers.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Here's an example of how to create a date input element.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>&lt;input type="date" /&gt;</paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    The above element shows the date input with not date inputted.

            </subsection>
            <subsection title="2.5 Email Input">
                <paragraph>
                    The input of type email creates an input text box that expects text in an email format. The input text box will verify 
                    if the input is in a correct email format when the form is submitted, but will not check if the email exists or not. It
                    is also possible for the input to accept multiple emails (separated by commas), if the multiple attribute is specified.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Here's an example of how to create an email input, and what it looks like if the form is to be submitted with an invalid
                    email format (or is submitted empty (the required attribute forces a value to be inputted into the input)).
                </paragraph>

                <paragraph>
                    The above element is an email input. Entering an invalid format email hightlight the input box red, while
                    entering a valid email (ex. email@email.com) will not.</paragraph>

                </image>
            </subsection>
            <subsection title="2.6 Number Input">
                <paragraph>
                    The number input allows the user to input a numeric value with type checking. It ensures that the user's input is a valid number.
                    As well, the input allows the developer to specify a minimum and maximum valid input range, which is useful for limiting the user's
                    valid inputs. This is done by setting the min attribute and the max attribute, respectively. There is also a spinner that is 
                    available to increase or decrease the user's value by a step amount, which can also be specified by the developer. Setting the
                    step attribute will change how much the spinner increments and decrements the numeric value. 
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>Here is an example of a number input, with a minimum of 5, maximum of 25, and a step of 2.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>&lt;input type="number" min="5" max="25" step="2" /&gt;</paragraph>

                </image>
                <paragraph>
                    If a number is submitted with a non-numeric value, or a value outside of the specified range, the user will be notified.
                    Here's an example, using the above example, when the user inputs a value outside of the valid range.

            <subsection title="2.7 Search Input">
                <paragraph>
                    The search input creates a text box search field that allows the user to input text for a query. There is also
                    an "x" that will clear the search box. As well, the placeholder attribute can be set to a text string to display
                    placeholder text within the search box.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>Here's an example of a search input.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>
                    The tel input type is used for telephone number inputs. The tel input doesn't validate if the inputted telephone number is
                    a real, valid number, but it does provide a pattern attribute to allow the developer to specify regular expressions (regex)
                    to test for a correct telephone input format. This is done because different regions have different telephone number formats.
                    This allows the tel input to be modified to suit any region. Once again, there is also a placeholder attribute to display
                    the required telephone input format
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>Here's an example of a tel input for a Canadian phone number format (###) ###-####.</paragraph>

            <subsection title="3.1 What is CSS?">
                <paragraph>
                    CSS (Cascading Style-sheet) is a style sheet language used to style HTML elements. CSS helps in creating aesthetically pleasing
                    web pages by allowing the developer to color structural elements, input elements, and just about anything else HTML related. It also
                    helps to layout the web application, as it can specify the sizes of of HTML elements. In turn, this means that CSS also helps
                    with the scalability of web applications on smaller and larger devices (such as scaling down from a desktop browser on a large screen,
                    to a mobile browser on a cellular device. Thus, it is obvious that CSS is an important aspect of web development.

            <subsection title="3.2 Inline CSS vs. an External Stylesheet">
                <paragraph>
                    There are two ways to modify HTML elements using CSS. The first way is through the use of inline css in the HTML elements.
                    This is where the CSS styles are applied directly to the HTML element (the HTML style attributes are modified directly in the
                    creation of the HTML element). An example of what this would look like on a div element would be:
                </paragraph>
                <image src="../shared/css_3-2.png">A div with a blue background</image>
                <image src="../shared/css_3-2_code.png">
                    &lt;div style="width:200px; height:200px; background-color:blue;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                </image>
                <paragraph>
                    As shown here, there is an attribute in the HTML div starting tag called style, and when that attribute is in place, CSS code
                    can be written to directly modify this element.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Using inline HTML may not be of best practice, as it can cause a lot of duplicated code (if multiple elements want to be styled
                    the same way), leading to a lack in maintainability and consistancy. What I mean by maintainability and consistancy is, is if there
                    are multiple webpages in which the same theme needs to be applied to all of the pages, then it becomes a tedious and
                    inefficient to style each and every element with the same styles.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    A more reasonable approach would be to use an external CSS stylesheet, which can be used to create a common style for certain
                    elements or certain groups of elements. This can be done in one of two ways. In the first method, a "style" element
                    (&lt;img src="../shared/3.2_2.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;) can be declared inside the HTML document that will allow for CSS styling
                    for a specific HTML file. This solution is better than the inline CSS, but still not the best, since the CSS code would need to
                    be duplicated in other HTML files as well. The best way is to use a separate CSS file (of type .css), where the stylesheet can be
                    referenced in each HTML file (using &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="yourstylesheet.css" /&gt;). Discussing some of
                    the attributes in the link tag, rel describes the relationship between the current document and the linked document, type defines 
                    the MIME type as a text with CSS formatting, and the href is the direct reference to the stylesheet. Thus, any HTML files that have 
                    the reference can use the CSS rule-set specified in the CSS file.

            <subsection title="3.3 Using External CSS Stylesheets">
                <paragraph>
                    First, let's begin be defining a CSS rule-set for an HTML element. As stated in the previous unit, HTML elements can be given unique IDs. 
                    In CSS, styles can be applied directly to an HTML element with a specific ID. For example, if there is an element declared as
                    &lt;img src="../shared/3.3_1.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
                    and we wanted to set the background color to red, it can be done in the CSS stylesheet as #myDiv { background-color:red; }. 
                    Notice how the div's ID was preceded by a '#'. The # symbol specifies that the CSS properties will be applied to an elements with that specific 
                    ID. Now let's say we wanted to apply the CSS properties to multiple HTML elements. A rule-set can be made similarly to how the rule-set 
                    was made for an ID, but replacing the '#' with a '.' (so using the above example, it would look like .myDiv { background-color:red; }). 
                    This rule-set can be applied to any HTML element by using the class attribute (so in the above div, it would be 
                    &lt;img src="../shared/3.3_2.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;.
                    Multiple CSS classes can be applied to an element. If you want CSS rule-sets to be applied to a certain HTML elements (such as applying the CSS 
                    rule-set to all div elements), then specify the HTML element name with nothing preceding it (so once again, for a div element it would look 
                    like div { background-color:red; } to apply a red background to all div's).

            <subsection title="4.1 What is JavaScript?">
                <paragraph>
                    JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that can be used to perform tasks to save time and data transfer between the server
                    and the client. For example, if there is a simple calculation, such as adding two inputs from the user, then it may be redundant
                    to have to send that data back to a server so it can return the result of such a simple calculation back. Just keep in mind that if
                    you are using JavaScript, do not store any sensitive data in JavaScript because anyone who has access to the website can use a console
                    viewer and view any of the data stored. JavaScript helps in making HTML more interactive, since it can create actions, effects, transitions,
                    etc when events occurs on an HTML element or page (such as clicking a button, typing into an input, etc.)
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    JavaScript can be used in similar ways as CSS can. Some JavaScript functions can be called for an event in an inline HTML element
                    (For example, &lt;img src="../shared/4.1_1.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt; would create a button that would call the functions
                    "javascriptFunction" when it is clicked). For similar reasons as with CSS, it is not recommended to call JavaScript functions in this
                    manner, as it makes maintainability and scalability more difficult. JavaScript can be declared inside an HTML file by using the
                    &lt;script&gt;"...JavaScript Here"&lt;/script&gt;. The JavaScript decan be defined between the two script tags. As well, JavaScript can
                    be defined outside of an HTML file, as its own external JavaScript file (ending with .js). The JavaScript can be included into any
                    HTML file by using the same script tag, but with a src attribute that points to the location of the JavaScript file (ex.
                    &lt;script src="../shared/myJavascriptFile.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;).

            <subsection title="4.2 Brief Introduction to AJAX">
                <paragraph>
                    In the discussions so far about web pages, the current way of communicating with a server is by using a form and refreshing the page
                    in order to send and receive data between the server and the client. This approach is fine, unless the user has to go through many
                    web pages, or is required to repeatedly input information. The reason why the the way we have been inputting information into the
                    web pages is bad for this type of application is because it takes too long. Refreshing the entire page to load data if whenever the
                    user wants to send in information can take a long time. This is especially true for validating inputs. For example, we don't want to
                    refresh the entire page just to check if one of the user's inputs is in the correct format. AJAX is a way around this, as it creates
                    a dynamic web page that is able to asynchronously send and receive data between the client and server and updating the webpage without
                    having to refresh the entire webpage.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    One way of creating an AJAX application is through the use of XMLHttpRequests, which sends and recieves XML data between the
                    server and the client. Here's an example of how to open a connection to asynchronously request from a server XML document and display
                    the requested information back to the client.
                </paragraph>
                <image src="../shared/4.2_1.png">
                    function readXML(url) {
                        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
                        xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
                            if (this.readyState === 4 &amp;&amp; this.status === 200) {
                                callbackFunction(this);
                            }
                        }
                        xhr.open("get", url, false);
                        xhr.send(null);
                    }
                </image>
                <paragraph>
                    Let's take a look at the above function, called readXML. This function will create an XMLHttpRequest to a URL, and when the request is
                    ready, then a callback function is called. First, this method takes in a url as an input, which is the path to the URL that the user will
                    be requesting from. The line &lt;img src="../shared/4.2_2.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt; creates the XMLHttpRequest and assigns it to a variable called xhr.
                    This variable will be used to deal with the XMLHttpRequest. The next chunk of code,
                </paragraph>
                <image src="../shared/4.2_3.png">
                    xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
                        if (this.readyState === 4 &amp;&amp; this.status === 200) {
                            callbackFunction(this);
                        }
                    }
                </image>
                <paragraph>
                    sets an event handler for the xhr variable, which will call a function if the ready state of the request changes. The function that
                    is called will check if the request is complete (readyState === 4) and that the client has successfully received the request (status === 200).
                    If these two conditions are satisfied, then a callback function is called, passing in the request (callbackFunction(this)). "this" contains all
                    of the information from the request. Before the onreadystatechange is called, the request must be opened first, which occurs in the lines 
                </paragraph>
                <image src="../shared/4.2_4.png">
                    xhr.open("get", url, false);
                    xhr.send(null);
                </image>
                <paragraph>
                    The xhr is opened using a "get" request to the URL. The third parameter, which is set to false, specifies if the request is asynchronous or not.
                    Finally, in the send method (xhr.send(null)), this means that the request is not submitting data in the body of the request.
